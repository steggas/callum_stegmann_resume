            <h4>I am looking to broaden my horizons and continuing to learn and find ways to use my technical skills to further and find new ones along the way and to improve on the ones that I have at hand.<br> I grew up in Cape Town South Africa, and have gone to school in Cape Town and
lived my first year out of school in Cape Town, working as an intern and an aspiring software developer.<br> In the year 2022, I hope to move over to Germany for the next chapter of my life and to find more job opportunities and universities to further my studies
